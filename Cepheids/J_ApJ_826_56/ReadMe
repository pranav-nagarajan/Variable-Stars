Abstract:
    We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope
    (HST) to reduce the uncertainty in the local value of the Hubble
    constant from 3.3% to 2.4%. The bulk of this improvement comes from
    new near-infrared (NIR) observations of Cepheid variables in 11 host
    galaxies of recent type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), more than doubling the
    sample of reliable SNe Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance to a
    total of 19; these in turn leverage the magnitude-redshift relation
    based on ~300 SNe Ia at z<0.15. All 19 hosts as well as the megamaser
    system NGC 4258 have been observed with WFC3 in the optical and NIR,
    thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors in the relative
    distance estimates from Cepheids. Other noteworthy improvements
    include a 33% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser
    distance to NGC 4258, a larger sample of Cepheids in the Large
    Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a more robust distance to the LMC based on
    late-type detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), HST observations of
    Cepheids in M31, and new HST-based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky
    Way (MW) Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of
    Cepheids: (i) megamasers in NGC 4258, (ii) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (iii) 15
    MW Cepheids with parallaxes measured with HST/FGS, HST/WFC3 spatial
    scanning and/or Hipparcos, and (iv) 2 DEBs in M31. The Hubble constant
    from each is 72.25+/-2.51, 72.04+/-2.67, 76.18+/-2.37, and
    74.50+/-3.27km/s/Mpc, respectively. Our best estimate of
    H_0_=73.24+/-1.74km/s/Mpc combines the anchors NGC 4258, MW, and LMC,
    yielding a 2.4% determination (all quoted uncertainties include fully
    propagated statistical and systematic components). This value is
    3.4{sigma} higher than 66.93+/-0.62km/s/Mpc predicted by {Lambda}CDM
    with 3 neutrino flavors having a mass of 0.06eV and the new Planck
    data, but the discrepancy reduces to 2.1{sigma} relative to the
    prediction of 69.3+/-0.7km/s/Mpc based on the comparably precise
    combination of WMAP+ACT+SPT+BAO observations, suggesting that
    systematic uncertainties in CMB radiation measurements may play a role
    in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck high-redshift
    measurements and our local determination of H_0_ at face value, one
    plausible explanation could involve an additional source of dark
    radiation in the early universe in the range of {Delta}N_eff_~0.4-1.
    We anticipate further significant improvements in H_0_ from upcoming
    parallax measurements of long-period MW Cepheids.

Description:
    The SH0ES (SNe, H0, for the Equation of State of dark energy) program
    has been selecting SNe Ia with the qualities detailed in section 2 to
    ensure a reliable calibration of their fiducial luminosity. The result
    is a nearly complete sample of 19 objects observed between 1993 and
    2015 (see Table 1).
